        Report: What Lower Manhattan businesses closed and opened during the
        pandemic?
      </h1>
      <!-- <p>Ideas for next steps:<br/>
        <ol>   
            <li>DONE ECOD: Heat map view per neighborhood. Overview at a higher level for heat map, lower level detail on dots</li>
            <li>ECOD: How one area is more heavily trafficked, does one street have a busier intersection by hour?</li>
            <li>ECOD: Histogram and map are synced to show development over time
            </li>
            <li>Overlay based on high foot traffic with opening/closures</li>
            <li>Overlay vacancies with pedestrian data</li>
            <li>As a total % of people (external data to be handed off), how many people are passing by the sensors</li>
            <li>People are interested in returning, map by dot how many are up or down % from month to month.</li>
            <li>Wednesday: finish stacked histogram</li>
            <li>Thurs: Filtering feature + some smaller graphs/charts</li>
            <li>Comparing pandemic opening/closure rates to pre-pandemic rates</li>
            <li>Overlaying neighborhood boundaries and subway stops to identify hard-hit areas. At first glance, the World Trade Center area and area by Fulton Street station seem to be two clusters.
            <li>Incorporating EcoDev pedestrian data</li>
            <li>Integrating Salesforce to update these maps live?</li>
            </li>
